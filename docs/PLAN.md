# Context Implementation Plan - Task Breakdown

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive task breakdown for implementing the Context AI-powered note-taking application based on the PRD. The plan is organized into phases with clear dependencies, technical implementation steps, and priority markers.

**Architecture Note**: This plan uses a unified Next.js 15+ App Router + Hono.js architecture for faster development (30-40% timeline reduction), simplified deployment, and reduced infrastructure costs (60-70% reduction) compared to traditional separated frontend/backend approaches.

## Backend Architecture Decision

**Chosen Solution**: Supabase as primary backend infrastructure

**Key Benefits**:

- **Unified Backend**: Single service for database, auth, real-time, and vector search
- **Cost Reduction**: Supabase Pro ($25/month) vs Neon ($25) + Upstash ($15) = $40/month savings
- **Simplified Architecture**: Fewer service integrations and API coordination overhead
- **Built-in Features**: Authentication, real-time subscriptions, and vector search out-of-the-box
- **PostgreSQL Native**: Full PostgreSQL compatibility with pgvector extension
- **Edge Optimization**: Global edge network with connection pooling

**When to Add Upstash Redis**:

- High-frequency caching needs (>10,000 requests/minute)
- Complex session management beyond Supabase capabilities
- Rate limiting at edge locations
- Advanced pub/sub messaging patterns

**Migration Considerations**:

- Supabase provides PostgreSQL dump/restore for easy migration
- Built-in connection pooling eliminates separate pooling setup
- Row Level Security (RLS) provides fine-grained access control
- Supabase CLI enables local development with Docker

## Technology Stack Overview

## UI Component Strategy

### Component Library Selection

**shadcn/ui (90% of UI Components)**:

- **Foundation**: All structural components (forms, tables, navigation)
- **Benefits**: Zero runtime overhead, full customization, built-in accessibility
- **Components for Context**:
  - DataTable + ScrollArea: The Log infinite scroll
  - Command + Popover: Magic Search interface
  - Card + Badge: Cluster suggestions
  - Form components: Authentication and settings
  - Dialog + Sheet: Modals and side panels

**Aceternity UI (10% for Key UX Moments)**:

- **Usage**: Selective animation enhancements
- **Components for Context**:
  - CardStack: Cluster suggestion presentations
  - Fade-in animations: New note appearances
  - Smooth transitions: Cluster-to-document promotion
  - Search result animations: Enhanced search UX
- **Performance Note**: Add only after Phase 1 performance benchmarking

### Implementation Guidelines

**Phase 1 (MVP): shadcn/ui Only**

- Focus on functionality and performance
- Establish component patterns and design system
- Ensure <200ms input lag requirement is met
- Build accessibility-first with Radix UI primitives

**Phase 2 (Polish): Selective Aceternity UI**

- Add animations after performance benchmarking
- A/B test animation impact on user engagement
- Implement motion preferences (prefers-reduced-motion)
- Monitor bundle size impact (target <30KB addition)

### Performance Optimization

**shadcn/ui Advantages**:

- Copy-paste architecture: No framework overhead
- Tree-shakable: Only ship used components
- Optimized for React Server Components
- TanStack Table virtualization for large datasets

**Aceternity UI Considerations**:

- Lazy-load Framer Motion only where needed
- Use CSS animations for simple transitions
- Implement progressive enhancement strategy
- Monitor Core Web Vitals impact

## Package Management Strategy
