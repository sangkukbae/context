# Context PRD - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Context** is an AI-powered note-taking application designed for entrepreneurs, product managers, and creative professionals who need to capture thoughts quickly while maintaining the ability to discover meaningful connections between ideas. The product addresses the fundamental tension between speed of capture (like Andrej Karpathy's "append-only" notes) and the need for structured information management in professional settings.

### Key Value Propositions

- **Zero-friction capture**: Record thoughts instantly without cognitive overhead
- **AI-powered connections**: Automatically discover relationships between disparate notes
- **Progressive structuring**: Transform raw ideas into structured documents with minimal effort
- **Seamless collaboration**: Bridge personal notes and team knowledge sharing

## Product Overview and Vision

### Vision Statement

To become the second brain for modern knowledge workers, where every thought is captured effortlessly and every connection is discovered intelligently.

### Product Philosophy

Based on Andrej Karpathy's "append-and-review" methodology, Context embraces the principle of "Capture fast, Context later." We believe that:

- The friction of organizing should never prevent the act of recording
- AI can bridge the gap between raw capture and structured knowledge
- Ideas have lifecycles and should naturally evolve from personal notes to team assets

### Core Differentiators

1. **Progressive Information Architecture**: Ideas naturally progress from Log � Clusters � Documents � Shared Knowledge
2. **AI-First Design**: Intelligence is built into the core workflow, not added as an afterthought
3. **Minimal Cognitive Load**: Users never need to make categorization decisions during capture
